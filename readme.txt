== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is SecurityScorecard? =

[SecurityScorecard](https://securityscorecard.com/), the leader in cybersecurity ratings, continuously monitors and scores over 12 million organizations using a familiar A-F grade scale that correlates with breach risk. Their platform uses proprietary techniques to identify the external digital assets that belong to an organization, and assess them for security issues.

= What grades will this show? =

Currently the SecurityScorecard badge of trust will show your grade if it is an A or a B. For lower grades it will not display the grade.

= How do I use the plugin? =

The easiest way to use the plugin is to simply drag and drop the widget called "SecurityScorecard Seal of Trust Badge." You can also use a shortcode called ssc-badge. `[ssc-badge]`. The shortcode has two options, `domain` and `hide_attribution`. Both are optional. Domain defaults to your website's domain and should not be changed in most circumstances. Setting `hide_attribution` to a value of "1" will remove the "Powered by SecurityScorecard" link under your badge.
